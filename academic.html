    <h2>The Digital Battlefield: Ransomware, Intrusions, and the Road to a Safer System</h2>

    <p>
      This study investigates how Swedish companies defend themselves against the growing threat of ransomware. 
      By combining literature research with interviews from six organizations across different industries, the report 
      explores technical preparedness, employee awareness, and the effectiveness of incident response plans.

    <p>
      The results show that most companies maintain a strong level of technical readiness — with updated antivirus 
      systems, network segmentation, and reliable backup strategies. However, the human factor remains the weakest link, 
      making employee training and phishing simulations crucial for reducing risks. Despite high security maturity, 
      many organizations rely heavily on external providers

      which may hinder internal learning and long-term resilience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The study also reveals a notable lack of transparency surrounding ransomware incidents. Companies often choose 
      silence over openness, prioritizing reputation protection over collective learning. This secrecy distorts the 
      public perception of cybersecurity threats and slows progress toward a stronger, more resilient digital society.
